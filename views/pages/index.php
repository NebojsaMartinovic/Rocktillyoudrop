                    <p>"Evil Walks": "As the name says, evil walks. It's everywhere. Actually it's just a catchy title with a catchy tune. We were playing it at the beginning and I said, 'those chords sound dead evil.' And that's usually how we do it – just sitting around and nattering and thinking and jamming away, and someone says something like 'evil walks' and that's it. Some crud just sent me a letter – addressed to Bon too – sending us these stupid things. Some people are sick. If they want to go God-bothering they should go God-bother the Pope. He needs it. We don't...I had one idiot trying to blast away in my earhole. He started with 'Do you believe in God?' and I said 'I've no interest in it so leave me alone.' Their main beef is songs like 'Highway to Hell.' But they're just titles. It's only a song."</p>

                    <p>And it came to pass That rock 'n' roll was born All across the land every rockin' band Was blowin' up a storm And the guitar man got famous The business man got rich And in every bar there was a superstar With a seven year itch There was fifteen million fingers Learnin' how to play And you could hear the fingers pickin' And this is what they had to say Let there be light.</p>
